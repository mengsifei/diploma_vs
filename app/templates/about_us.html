    <p style="text-indent: 40px; text-align:left;">
        Welcome to the project page for Meng Sifei's course work, a comprehensive system designed to evaluate English 
        essays based on the IELTS rubrics. The primary goal of this project is to develop an automated tool that 
        can accurately score essays on four critical criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, 
        Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. This project aims to provide a reliable 
        and objective means of essay assessment, helping both learning and evaluation processes in educational 
        settings.

        The IELTS (International English Language Testing System) is a widely recognized standard for 
        assessing English language proficiency. It is used by educational institutions, employers, 
        and immigration authorities worldwide. To meet the specified standards set by IELTS, this project 
        leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and neural network to evaluate essays 
        with a high degree of precision and consistency.

        The project focuses on the following four criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-indent: 40px; text-align:left;">
            <strong>Task Response:</strong> This criterion evaluates how well the essay addresses the prompt. 
            It checks if the writer has answered all parts of the question, developed a clear position, 
            and supported their arguments with relevant examples. An effective task response ensures that the 
            essay stays on topic and thoroughly covers all aspects of the task.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li style="text-indent: 40px; text-align:left;">
            <strong>Coherence and Cohesion:</strong> This criterion assesses the logical flow and organization 
            of the essay. It examines how ideas are connected and how effectively the essay uses cohesive 
            devices (such as conjunctions and transitions) to link sentences and paragraphs. Good coherence 
            and cohesion make an essay easy to follow and understand.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li style="text-indent: 40px; text-align:left;">
            <strong>Lexical Resource:</strong> This criterion evaluates the range and accuracy of vocabulary 
            used in the essay. It looks at the writerâ€™s ability to use a wide variety of words and phrases 
            accurately and appropriately. This includes the use of idiomatic expressions, collocations, and less 
            common lexical items that enhance the essay's overall quality.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li style="text-indent: 40px; text-align:left;">
            <strong>Grammatical Range and Accuracy:</strong> This criterion assesses the writer's command of 
            grammatical structures. It evaluates the variety and correctness of sentence structures, verb tenses, 
            punctuation, and syntax. An essay that demonstrates a high level of grammatical proficiency is easier to 
            read and more effective in communicating its message.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px; text-align:left;">
        By implementing this automated essay scoring system, the project aims to provide students 
        and educators with a powerful tool for improving writing skills and ensuring fair and consistent 
        evaluation. The system can be used for practice, feedback, and formal assessment, helping learners to 
        identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time. Ultimately, the project seeks to 
        enhance the teaching and learning of English writing by leveraging technology to provide high-quality,
        accessible, and efficient essay evaluations.
