The myriad of scientific innovations is ubiquitous in our daily lives, with many asserting that science exists to enhance our well-being. From tools simplifying household chores to groundbreaking healthcare discoveries, I fully align with this perspective, as elaborated in the following essay.\nNumerous scientific innovations focus on improving lives, ranging from tools like washing machines and vacuum cleaners that reduce the time spent on household chores to impactful findings in the healthcare sector. An illustrative example is the advent of electricity, which has illuminated our world, dispelling darkness and enabling activities during nighttime or in dark conditions. More advanced examples include the discovery of antibiotics, mitigating the strength of viruses and fostering overall health. Regardless of the scientific domain, these advancements have undeniably made our lives easier, indirectly contributing to an enhanced quality of life.\nMoreover, science addresses environmental issues, striving to create a better living environment. Air pollution, a current focal point among scientists, has altered human behaviour, making masks a basic fashion item today. In the past, masks were not commonly used, but now they are essential due to deteriorating air quality. Furthermore, children who once spent the majority of their time outdoors are now confined indoors due to concerned parents protecting them from poor air quality. Government initiatives, coupled with scientific research, aim to ameliorate these conditions by promoting renewable energy and public transportation. Environmental advancements are expected to elevate people’s overall quality of life.\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree that the ultimate goal of science is to improve people’s lives. This is evident in the diverse innovations surrounding us, from simple cleaning tools to the integration of science in medical and environmental aspects.

Prompt2:
Competition for university study is becoming increasingly strong. Why are universities becoming more competitive? Is this a positive or negative development?
Essay2:
It is widely acknowledged that in numerous nations around the world, a number of individuals think that higher education is becoming more and more competitive. In this essay, I will scrutinize the reasons responsible for this trend, and I vehemently believe that it is a positive development for overall knowledge growth among pupils. I will offer some relevant examples to illustrate the current state of affairs.\nTo begin with, there are manifold factors responsible for universities organizing that kind of admissions competition. One primary reason is that recruitment competitions provide a way to find geniuses who have great knowledge about academic subjects. to express that in every admissions test, more than 30 million preschoolers attend this challenge to admit themselves to a rebound university, although this test provides the chance for only 1 million students to admit. According to a report by the reputed news source, the Daily Star, universities implement these stringent selection processes to identify and educate gifted students who have the potential to contribute towards societal development.\nThere are multiple rationales that support the contention that heightened competition in university admissions is beneficial. Firstly, competition among students fosters a more conducive learning atmosphere. For example, students striving to gain admission to prestigious universities are compelled to demonstrate their academic prowess through competitive examinations. This not only helps them navigate challenges effectively but also enhances their prospects for a successful career trajectory. Research conducted by Oxford University indicates that individuals who engage in academic competitions are more likely to secure lucrative career opportunities compared to their peers who lack such experiences.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that competition for university places plays a pivotal role in students’ lives, it is prudent to acknowledge its associated drawbacks. Nonetheless, it is imperative to encourage individuals to participate in these competitive processes, as they serve as a benchmark for assessing one’s academic acumen and pave the way for better career prospects.
